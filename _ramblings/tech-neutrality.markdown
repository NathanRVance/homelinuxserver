Search the internet for "technology morally neutral", and you get a vast sea of ideas regarding the topic. Many claim that technology is indeed morally neutral, and that every piece of technology can be used for good and for evil alike.

## Hammers

It's plesant to point to tools like hammers and say that, sure, the hammer could empower you to hit someone over the head, but it also empowers you to build a house. Such morally neutral tools exist and are plentiful. But that's only part of the story. Some technologies, perhaps even most, have a moral bent, either for destruction or construction.

## Guns

Consider a gun. A popular quote, quipped often by the NRA and the like, is that

>Guns don't kill people. People kill people.

This makes total sense, and the same can be said for knives, bazookas, and nuclear warheads. But consider the possible uses of a gun:

 * killing people
 * hunting
 * target practice (for killing people or for hunting)

The point of guns is to empower people to destroy things at a distance. At worst this is morally evil when the destroyed thing is a person, and at best this is morally neutral when hunting or target practicing. Therefore, gun use falls somewhere on the evil side of the good-evil spectrum. Does this make the gun morally evil? I think so.

## Toothbrushes

Again, consider the toothbrush. Such an instrument grants its wielder the powers to:

 * brush teeth
 * clean other stuff
 * clean your gun that you use to shoot people

The point of toothbrushes is to empower people to clean stuff, mostly teeth (hence the name). An edge usage case is to clean non-teeth, and the evil use of the toothbrush is to clean things that will be used for evil purposes. Point is, that's a bit of a stretch. I'd consider cleaning in general to be morally good, and though the object of the cleaning may be used for evil, that doesn't mar the fact that cleaning is a good thing. Does this make the toothbrush morally good? I think so.

## How this all aplies to tech

Every specific instance of technology falls (albeit loosely) into one of the three categories:

 * Hammer-like, having neither a constructive nor a destructive bias, are morally neutral
 * Gun-like, having a destructive bias, are morally evil
 * Toothbrush-like, having a constructive bias, are morally good.

In the tech industry, hammers, guns, and toothbrushes are still being invented. Corporate and governmental sponsors unfortunately seem to only be interested in developing guns, which currently take the form of big data collection and processing technologies. Given the money being thrown at them, we can expect their accuracy and caliber to dramatically increase in the coming years.

Toothbrushes in tech tend to be open source, simply because governments and corporations aren't interested in developing them in secret. A good example is cryptography, which serves the purpose of keeping data private - generally a good thing. Of course, like a toothbrush used to clean a gun, cryptography can be abused to facilitate evils like DRM. Even so, computer users with access to cryptography are empowered to encrypt their data, thus defending against data harvesting.

## What should we do about it?

What we shouldn't do is make the guns of the tech industry illegal. That move would be antithetical to everything that free software stands for. In fact, in order to be true to the freedoms that we advocate, _we_ shouldn't do anything.

But what should _I_ do? I should use my software development skills to invent toothbrushes instead of guns. I should develop strategies and tools for defending against the weapons that are being rolled out, and I should strive to warn other about the danger embedded in seemingly innocuous data harvesting schemes.
