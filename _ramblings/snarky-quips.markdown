Here are some ideas that I have stumbled across, rephrased to sound clever and/or poetic.

## Reversals

>It's better to try and fail than it is to fail to try.

>The thing with tech companies is: until they lose you as a user, theyâ€™ll use you like a loser.

>Every utopia is a dystopia for the beneficiary; but every dystopia is a utopia for the rebel.

## Prose & Poems

The Pendulum  
>Religious freedom stems from persecution;  
>And freedom of speech comes from censorship.  
>Political freedom rises against authoritarianism;  
>And economic freedom, from the ineptitude of socialism.  
>Those who desire power commit these atrocities,  
>And so spur freedom for the next generation.  
>But if these wrongs go undone,  
>Then we forget our freedoms' importance,  
>And we disregard them as archaic,  
>And we destroy them, for after all,  
>They are naught but problematic.  

Names (by anonymous)  
>Names carved on wood, names hewn on stone,  
>Intended to be forever known.  
>Lovers from the past and the great Caesars of old,  
>On wood and on stone their deeds they told.  
>_I was here_, alike they declare;  
>_I came, I saw, I conquered - Beware!_  
>But once they are gone, does anyone care?  
>For just as wood rots away, so stone wears away;  
>Perhaps these great names were never meant to stay.  

## Self Reference

>Under the correct level of abstraction, one can find misinformation anywhere, even in this sentence.

>never trust a badly writen arugment thats to genralized and relys on anectdotal evidance there all bad i never trust them and you shudent too
