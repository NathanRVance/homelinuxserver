I have no idea where these quotes came from; if you can't find them outside of this site, then they probably originated from my subconscious.

>It's better to try and fail than it is to fail to try.

>The thing with tech companies is: until they lose you as a user, theyâ€™ll use you like a loser.

>Every utopia is a distopia for the beneficiary; but every distopia is a utopia for the rebel.
