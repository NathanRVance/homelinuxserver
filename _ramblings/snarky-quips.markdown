>Religious freedom comes from persecution;
>Freedom of speech comes from censorship;
>Political freedom comes from authoritarianism;
>Economic freedom comes from socialism.
>Commit these atrocities and you guarantee that freedom flourishes in the next generation.
>But if these wrongs go undone,
>Then we forget our freedoms' importance,

>Names (by anonymous)
>Names carved on wood, names hewn on stone;
>Intended to be forever known.
>Lovers from the past, and the great Caesars of old,
>On wood, and on stone, their deeds they told.

>For just as wood rots away, so stone wears away.
>Perhaps these great names were never meant to stay.
