Everybody is a slave to something or to somebody. This isn't a situation that we can opt out of - it's a fact of life. As humans, we serve a collection of people, things, and ideologies. Most people have a huge array of masters to satisfy, and at times it can be impossible to simultaneously satisfy all of them. In such situations it becomes necessary to prioritize.

Assuming priorities are relatively consistent, one can construct a directed graph in which nodes on the graph represent masters over one's life, and an edge from one master to another indicates that the first master is prioritized over the other. If the graph happens to be acyclic (huge problems can arise if it's not), a topological sort reveals the chain of command in one's life. Who knew that graph theory could be so philosophical?

Worthy of note is that everyone has a node in their hierarchy representing themselves, but mankind has yet to produce someone narcissistic enough to succeed in placing themselves at the head. In the case of everyone's favourite Star Wars character, Han Solo, his "self" node seems to be first topologically. But even with Han, an idealized, romanticized, scruffy scoundrel, though he thinks that he is number 1, in actuality he serves something far more basic than that. Whether he's motivated by self preservation when escaping the [Exogorth](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Exogorth), or money when saving Leia, Han's actions betray that his real masters are instinct and greed. And yet, he obstinately insists:

>I take orders from just one person: me.

-Han Solo

Alright, Han. Whatever you say. But, when I imagine independence and full freedom to do whatever I want, do I envision anything more than Han Solo's shallow lifestyle? I'd be fooling myself if I thought that I, by serving myself, would be more than just a slave to my base instincts and desires. I simply can't not be a slave to my master - whichever entity is at the head of the chain of command in my life.

It can take some honest and painful introspection to determine what one's own master is, even if it's obvious to others. Perhaps, like Han, you like to think that that master is yourself. Also like Han, this means that you answer to some instincts and desires that are much less noble than you care to admit. Or, the master may be addiction - much more difficult to justify, but nonetheless an extremely powerful authoritarian dictator in many lives.

There are as many possible masters as we humans care to invent, but my master, and the master of all Christians, is God. The Apostle Paul explains in his letter to the Christians in Rome:

>When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.

-Romans 6:20-22

So how about that elephant in the room? This site is all about decentralization, from software to governance to economics. But it doesn't appear that Christianity is compatible with any of those ideas. And not just Christianity - if human nature always forms a hierarchy of masters, then even human nature is incompatible with decentralization of power. It's hopeless. This is a deathblow to the very concept of freedom itself.

Whole philosophies and systems of government have been built on this concept: we need a strong man to take the position as everyone's master, otherwise anarchy will naturally select one. Whether the strong man is a literal man in the form of a dictator, or it's a government, or an idea like science, or perhaps a big company, this ideology insists that the strong man is assigned from on high. What I'm describing is the centralized approach to master assignment.

But there is hope. Freedom isn't doomed. However, the stakes are much, much higher than most realize. The whole point of freedom is that we choose to be free. Or not. That's why freedom is so fragile. If freedom was forced, then it wouldn't be freedom.

The decentralized approach to master assignment allows everyone to choose who or what they will serve. Some will choose poorly, and I mourn every case where God is not the master. But the alternative, where I force everyone to be subservient to God alone, gives absolute power to me, not God. Not only would this arrangement be unacceptable from a decentralization standpoint, but also from a theological one!

Let's summarize with some Q&A.

## Isn't Christianity a centralized, siloed system?

Yes. Jesus said, "I am *the* way, *the* truth, and *the* life. No one comes to the Father, except through me."

## But centralization is bad, you [said so](open-source-philosophy.html) yourself!

When humans are involved, centralization is nothing more than us trying to play God. Authoritarianism is our silly attempt at omnipotence, big data is omniscience, and IoT is omnipresence. These are all bad things when humans wield them, but they are all qualities that God already possesses, and no amount of objection can strip them away from Him. The Good News is that He loves us so much that, even when we were enemies, He became weakness for us to save us from our evil and the death that it leads to.

## Aha! I knew you were making God an exception, a hard-coded clause in your otherwise elegant philosophy!

I assume, if you have that objection, that this is a case of tl;dr. This thought process is a direct result of having an unrealistic view on human nature. Every human being that ever existed had a master, be it instinct, sin, God, or otherwise. Of all the masters out there, God is the only one that is incorruptible by power, and thus is the only good master.

Decentralization comes in when we are allowed to choose who or what we will serve. This happens to be God's approach when it comes to attracting us unto Him. In contrast, centralization in this context is when our masters are assigned from on high.

## Alright, so you're saying that God is the lesser of an array of evils?

No, I'm saying that God is the only good. Subjugation to Him is the only way anyone can truly experience freedom.

## This is madness. I'm going to go do XYZ.

Very well. But as you do XYZ, think on this: who or what do you serve? Are you a slave to XYZ or something like it? Is it worthy of your devotion?
