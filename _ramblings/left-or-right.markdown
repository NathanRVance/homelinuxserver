Something interesting has happened recently in political discourse: The Internet. It's a beautiful thing; we now can communicate with people all around the world, freely exchanging ideas. Not only that, but we don't have to listen to the idiots on the other side of the isle. Those morons never had anything relevant to say anyway.

One tiny problem. What exactly is the left-right divide? I ask because I consider myself more libertarian than right or left. However, I found myself on the right because, oddly enough considering historical left-right stereotypes, the right is currently more tolerant to anti-authoritarian ideas. But as the pendulum swings back toward center, I've started paying closer attention to left vs. right talking points, and have discovered that they are basically equivalent. Not policy-wise, but certaintly in terms of values.

## A Parisian Rant

We on the (<font color='blue'>left</font>/<font color='red'>right</font>) have the moral high ground against the (<font color='blue'>racist Nazi bigots</font>/<font color='red'>regressive Commie SJWs</font>). Those authoritarian (<font color='blue'>capitalists</font>/<font color='red'>socialists</font>) deny the rights of the (<font color='blue'>working class</font>/<font color='red'>small businesses</font>) by centralizing power in the corrupt (<font color='blue'>corporations</font>/<font color='red'>government</font>). And when we point it out, they wine about how true (<font color='blue'>free markets</font>/<font color='red'>democratic socialism</font>) has never been tried! No, the truth on the matter is that (<font color='blue'>capitalism</font>/<font color='red'>socialism</font>) has been tried, and has failed. Just look at (<font color='blue'>Rutherford</font>/<font color='red'>Venezuela</font>)! It's undeniable, objective fact that (<font color='blue'>capitalism</font>/<font color='red'>socialism</font>) will always lead to (<font color='blue'>monopolistic corporatism</font>/<font color='red'>authoritarian regimes</font>).

As is clearly self-evident, the only way to fight fiscal authoritarianism is through a (<font color='blue'>socialistic</font>/<font color='red'>capitalistic</font>) economy. When we vote (<font color='blue'>for good policies</font>/<font color='red'>with our dollars</font>), we can be confident that the decentralized (<font color='blue'>democratic</font>/<font color='red'>capitalistic</font>) system on which our nation was built will ensure maximum freedom for the people.

The biggest social problems we face today are caused by those (<font color='blue'>racist bigots</font>/<font color='red'>shrieking SJW's</font>), along with their entourage of (<font color='blue'>internet trolls</font>/<font color='red'>corporate media outlets</font>). They try to de-platform us with their authoritarian tactics such as (<font color='blue'>hate speech</font>/<font color='red'>hit pieces</font>), and I receive so much of it that I've honestly become desensitized. By the way, (<font color='blue'>the Media</font>/<font color='red'>you all</font>) should (<font color='blue'>target</font>/<font color='red'>raid</font>) (<font color='blue'>them</font>/<font color='red'>their channels</font>). Even if they refuse to listen, hopefully someone in their audience (<font color='blue'>listens to reason</font>/<font color='red'>gets red-pilled</font>).

I labor on, striving, as always, to provide you with unbiased political analysis. Until next time,

## Authoritarian Conspiracy

I will now make the most libertarian statement I have ever generated:

> The bipartisan system is a product of a conspiracy by the socio-economic elites (and the deep state) to mold the world into an ever more authoritarian dystopia.

I believe that there is a huge segment of both the political left and right that is, at the very least, adamantly anti-authoritarian. And yet, every election cycle sees our government and our corporatistic conglomerates get bigger and more powerful. I'd bet good money that over half of the population would go to extremes to see this situation get reversed. And yet here we are, voting for either a donkey that will inflate the government, or an elephant that will encourage mergers. Who benefits? The socio-economic elites. Who loses? Literally everybody else.

Whether it's actually a conspiracy or just an unfortunate result of internet echo chambers, too many of us find ourselves vilifying the other end of the political spectrum, even if our own "end" is more a slight leaning than an ideological stance. This is a trap that way too many people are falling into. I consider myself lucky to have caught myself before falling headlong into it, and I hope that others can do the same.
