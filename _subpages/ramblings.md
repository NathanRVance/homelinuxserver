The internet today is centralized by default. Communication over the internet most often goes through a siloed provider. Entertainment is hosted and provided by a centralized source. Searching for information requires passing a query to a centralized server, then trusting it to return unbiased results. This centralized model in information technology is dangerous, for several reasons. This list is in order from most benign to most insidious (in my opinion).

 1. Danger of overzealous policing: "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged."
 2. Danger of unwelcome intimacy: When communication (gmail), entertainment (YouTube), and knowledge (Search) are all channeled through the same entity, then that entity has all the pieces required to understand you better than you understand yourself.
 3. Danger of the Omnicient Manipulator: When we trust an entity that knows us intimately as our source of information, we fall subject to that entity's adjenda, whatever that may be.

Item 1 is an excellent scapegoat for all of our suspicions because we love to yell about censorship. But, items 2 and 3 represent the greatest source of danger in the coming decade. The solution is decentralization. Below are a few of my thoughts regarding the topic.
