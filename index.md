Far too many of us rely heavily on closed source technologies for services such as email, calendars, file storage, and more. Doing so gives control over communication, personal life, and personal data to the small number of entities that run those services. This kind of consolidation of power is fundimentally anti-democratic, not to mention dangerous.

Here's a cliche for you: Tech companies will use you like a loser unless they lose you as a user.

Ah, but what other options do we have? There are very few free alternatives that aren't just as bad as what we're leaving. It seems like the only choice is to pay a subscription, which sucks. Of course, the other option is to host your own, but servers are a pain. Reserving a domain name, obtaining SSL keys, and setting up services are all non-trivial, often require a static IP address, and can be quite expensive. But things don't have to be this way. The server that this site is running on has all of this, resides in a living room, and was configured at zero monetary cost!

Anyone with a Linux desktop and an internet connection (even a residential one with an ever changing IP) can reduce or eliminate reliance on closed source services. Some of these services can be replaced outright by a home linux server. Others require client side software.

This site provides documentation for setting up a secure, simple, and complete home linux server.
 * Secure: Best practice is used to encrypt and lock down every part of the system.
 * Simple: This is a home linux server, not a enterprise system. Scalability is assumed to not be an issue, allowing us to avoid rather painful technologies such as [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29).
 * Complete: The end result is a server that provides web pages, email, calendars, backups, and more.
