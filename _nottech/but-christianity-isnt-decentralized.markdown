Everybody is a slave to something or to somebody. This isn't a situation we can opt out of - it's a basic fact. We humans serve a hierarchy of people, things, and ideologies. If two of the entities that we serve are opposed, and we select one over the other, than that one is higher in the hierarchy. Assuming the slave graph is directed and acyclic, a simple topological sort can reveal the chain of command in one's life. Who knew that graph theory could be so philisophical?

Worthy of note is that everyone has a node in their hierarchy representing themselves (in the case of Han Solo, this node is #1). But even in the case of Han, an idealized, romanticized, scruffy scoundrel, when he thought that he was number 1, in actuality it was something more base than that. Whether he's motivated by self preservation when escaping the [Exogorth](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Exogorth), or money when saving Leia, Han obstinately insists:

>I take orders from just one person: me.

-Han Solo

Alright, Han. Whatever you say. But, when I imagine independence and full freedom to do whatever I want, isn't this nothing more than desiring Han Solo's lifestyle? I'd be fooling myself if I thought that I, by serving myself, would be more than just a slave to my base instincts and desires. I simply can't not be a slave to my master - whichever entity is at the head of the chain of command in my life.

It can take some honest and painful introspection to determine what one's own master is, even if it's obvious to others. Perhaps, like with Han, that master is yourself. Also like Han, this means that you probably answer to some instincts and desires that are much less noble than you care to admit. Or, the master may be addiction - much more difficult to justify, but nonetheless an extremely powerful authoritarian dictator in many lives.

There are as many possible masters as we humans care to invent, but my master, and the master of all Christians, is God. The Apostle Paul explains in his letter to the Christians in Rome:

>When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.

-Romans 6:20-22

So how about that elephant in the room? This site is all about decentralization, from software to governance to economics. But it doesn't appear that Christianity is compatible with any of those ideas. And not just Christianity - if human nature always forms a hierarchy of masters, then even human nature is incompatible with decentralization of power.

Whole philosophies and systems of government have been built on this concept: we need a strong man to take the position as everyone's master, otherwise anarchy will naturally select one. Whether the strong man is a literal man in the form of a dictator, or it's a government, or an idea like science, or perhaps a big company, this ideology insists that the strong man is assigned from on high. What I'm describing is the centralized approach to master assignment.

The decentralized approach to master assignemnt allows everyone to choose who or what they will serve. Some will choose poorly, and I mourn every case where God is not the master. But the alternative, where I force everyone to be subserviant to God alone, gives absolute power to me, not God. Not only would this arrangement be unacceptable from a decentralization standpoint, but also from a theological one!

Let's summarize with some Q&A.

## Isn't Christianity a centralized, siloed system?

Yes. "I am *the* way, *the* truth, and *the* life. No one comes to the Father, except through me" -Jesus

## But centralization is bad, you [said so](open-source-philosophy.html) yourself!

When humans are involved, centralization is nothing more than us trying to play God. Authoritarianism is our silly attempt at omnipotence, big data is omnicience, and IoT is omnipresence. But these are all qualities that God already posesses, and no amount of objection can strip these away from Him. The Good News is that He loves us so much that, even when we were enemies, He became weakness for us to save us from our evil and the death that it leads to.

## Aha! I knew you would make God an exception, a hard-coded clause in your otherwise elegant philosophy!

I assume, if you have that objection, that this is a case of tl;dr. This thought process is a direct result of having an unrealistic view on human nature. Every human being that ever existed had a master, be it themselves, sin, God, or otherwise. Of all the masters out there, God is the only one that is uncorruptable by power, and thus is the only good master.

Decentralization comes in when we choose who or what we will serve. This happens to be God's approach when it comes to attracting us unto Him. In contrast, centralization in this context is when our masters are assigned.
