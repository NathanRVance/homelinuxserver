This server, vance.homelinuxserver.org, runs Debian 9 and was configured entirely using free and open source technology. It is part of a larger system of free and open source technologies that makes it possible for me, the primary user of this server, to cut ties with large tech companies like Google. The goal of this site is to document the process of setting up this server so that others can do the same.

Of course, this server isn't sufficient to cut all my ties to Google. The scope of this server covers the following:
 * [Postfix](/serverdocs/email-with-postfix.html) to replace Gmail.
 * [Nextcloud](/serverdocs/file-sharing-with-nextcloud.html) to replace Google Drive (or Backup and Sync, whatever).
   * Pair it with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to replace Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
   * Install a plugin to replace Google Calendar.
   * Another plugin replaces the Gmail web client.
   * And another for video calls.

There are many more services that can't be hosted by a home linux server (at least not as easily). I can still recommend a couple open source alternatives:
 * [LBRY](/clientdocs/videos-with-lbry.html) to replace YouTube.
 * [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) to replace Google Search.
 * [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about) to replace social media (Google Plus to stay on theme).

Shamefully, there are several things that I have no good recommendations for:
 * Google Voice. Maybe [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) someday? If it bridged SMS, then yes. But it doesn't (yet), so no.
 * Android phones, and the Google Play ecosystem that goes with them. Right now, nothing. But [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) looks like it will be awesome when it ships in 2019!
   * If all you need is a handheld, there are [many linux handhelds](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4biamr/a_list_of_handheldpocket_linux_computers/) out there.
 * Google Maps. For reference, the privacy loving DuckDuckGo defaults to Bing Maps. There isn't much out here, at least not much decent.

If there are errors on this site, or I overlooked something and used an inferior technology, please submit an issue at this site's [github page](https://github.com/NathanRVance/homelinuxserver/issues).
