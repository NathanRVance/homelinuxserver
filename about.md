The purpose of this site is to provide documentation for setting up a secure, simple, and complete home linux server at zero monetary cost (assuming internet access and router control, of course).
 * Secure: Best practice is used to encrypt and lock down every part of the installation
 * Simple: This is a home linux server, not a enterprise system. Scalability is assumed to not be an issue, allowing us to avoid rather painful technologies such as [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29).
 * Complete: The end result is a server that serves [web pages](../serverdocs/https-with-nginx.html), [email](../serverdocs/email-with-postfix.html), calendars, backups, etc.

The goal behind this is to enable anyone with a linux desktop and an internet connection (even a residential one with an ever changing IP) to be able to reduce reliance on closed source servers, such as Google services. There are many Google technologies that can't simply be replecated in a home server, for example, YouTube is far too dauting to serve up on your own. For these situaitons, I will recommend replacements, such as [LBRY](../clientdocs/videos-with-lbry.html).
