The purpose of this site is to provide documentation for setting up a secure, simple, and complete home linux server at zero monetary cost (assuming internet access and router control, of course).
 * Secure: Best practice is used to encrypt and lock down every part of the installation
 * Simple: This is a home linux server, not a enterprise system. Scalability is assumed to not be an issue, allowing us to avoid rather painful technologies such as kerberos.
 * Complete: The end result is a server that serves web pages, email, calendars, backups, and everything else I have time to implement.
